                <p>I have 6.5 years of experience as a software developer. Throughout my career, I have worked across organizations of different sizes
and contributed to building products from scratch and also to existing products which includes end-to-end features. </p>
          
                <p> I enjoy coding and <strong>solving technology problems</strong>.
                    I also like speaking at conferences and meetups about building back-end systems and writing better code. If you are looking for a speaker for your meetup or conference, feel free to DM me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vermastuti/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>For the past 5
years, Iâ€™m building a community called Women Who Code Delhi, which has helped me strengthen my network and given a place to
share my knowledge with people from diverse backgrounds. I have got first-hand exposure of managing partnerships,
sponsorships and collaborations with communities, enterprises and startups.</p>
